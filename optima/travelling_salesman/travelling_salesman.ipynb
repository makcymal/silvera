In each generation, except for the first, the ants rely on pheromones left behind by previous generations. From every node, several ants leave (`n_ants` parameter) in every generation. The ants in each node select the next node randomly with respect to the pheromone signals on the edges. Additionally, there are elite ants (`n_elites` parameter) who only follow the best routes (i.e., those with the most pheromone signals).

    "#### Simulated annealing technique\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the method of simulated annealing is an analogy with thermodynamics, specifically with the way that liquids freeze and crystallize, or metals cool and anneal. At high temperatures, the molecules of a liquid move freely with respect to one another. If the liquid is cooled slowly, thermal mobility is lost. The atoms are often able to line themselves up and form a pure crystal that is completely ordered over a distance up to billions of times the size of an individual atom in all directions. This crystal is the state of minimum energy for this system. The amazing fact is that, for slowly cooled systems, nature is able to find this minimum energy state. In fact, if a liquid metal is cooled quickly or “quenched,” it does not reach this state but rather ends up in a polycrystalline or amorphous state having somewhat higher energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the essence of the process is slow cooling, allowing ample time for redistribution of the atoms as they lose mobility. This is the technical definition of annealing, and it is essential for ensuring that a low energy state will be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even at low temperature, there is a chance, albeit very small, of a system being in a high energy state. In other words, the system sometimes goes uphill as well as downhill; but the lower the temperature, the less likely is any significant uphill excursion. **A simulated thermodynamic system is assumed to change its configuration from energy $E_1$ to energy $E_2$ with probability** $p = \\exp{\\cfrac{-(E_2 - E_1)}{kT}}$. The quantity $k$ (Boltzmann’s constant) is a constant of nature that relates temperature to energy."
