    "The algorithm simulates the behavior of ants. In nature, ants leave pheromone trails. The ant wanders randomly, unless it comes across a pheromone trail.In that case, it is more likely that it will follow the trail. The more pheromones there are, the more ants have passed through here, meaning this route is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm creates several generations (their number is controlled by the `n_gener` parameter) of ant colonies, one after the other. In each generation, except for the first, the ants rely on pheromones left behind by previous generations. From every node, several ants leave (`n_ants` parameter) in every generation. The ants in each node select the next node randomly with respect to the pheromone signals on the edges. Additionally, there are elite ants (`n_elites` parameter) who only follow the best routes (i.e., those with the most pheromone signals). First generation starts with equal pheromones on each edge (`pher_init`). From generation to generation, pheromones evaporate with a certain coefficient (`vapor_cf`). \n",
