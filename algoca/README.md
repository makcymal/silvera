### Data structures and algorithms in C++
- `graph`: 
    - Vertex degree
    - Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest paths from the given vertex
    - Euler cycle finding (through all the edges)
    - Floyd algorithm for finding the shortest paths from every vertex to each other
    - Hamilton cycle finding (through all the vertices)
    - Breads-, Depth-First Search (latter in both recursive and iterative forms)
- Binary search for finding element occurence, it's lower and upper bound in sorted array
- Disjoint Set Union
- Fenwick tree
- Segment tree
- Sequential algorithms for finding cycle in linked list or functional sequence (Floyd, Brent)
- Strings algorithms for finding substring occurence in string (prefix function, z-function), for palindromic substrings finding (Manacker)
